# Nextcloud Windmill integration

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/nextcloud/integration_windmill)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/nextcloud/integration_windmill)

A seamless integration between Nextcloud and Windmill that allows you to automate workflows, sync data, and orchestrate processes with your standalone [Windmill](https://windmill.dev) instance.

This project bridges Nextcloud’s collaboration and file platform with Windmill’s powerful automation engine — enabling low-code workflows, background jobs, and event-driven automation.

## Features

- Automated workflows triggered by Nextcloud events

- Execution of various workflow actions directly in your Nexcloud  

- Secure authentication via temporary tokens or app passwords

- Configurable triggers and actions

- Low-code workflow creation using Windmill UI

More details on how to set this up in the [admin docs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/windmill_workflows/index.html)
